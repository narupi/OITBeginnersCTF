List of known bugs in Pkcrack-1.2.2
===================================

 - pkcrack does not support the complete ZIP file format as specified in
   appnote.txt.
 - pkcrack reports fairly often to have found false hits. While this is not
   necessarily a bug, it's a behaviour I didn't expect.
 - The documentation seems to (still) be unclear on some points. Sigh.

 - For some reason(s) the test suite doesn't run under Solaris. Probably
   requires GNU make, mktemp etc.
 - src/Makefile also requires GNU make. It will work with /usr/ccs/bin/make
   on Solaris if you remove the "if DJGPP...endif" lines.
